# AgroEcoServices

This repository contains code and analysis for comparing **soil ecosystem services** across different land-use types:

- **Permaculture systems** (edible forests and garden beds)  
- **Conventional agriculture fields**  
- **Woodlands** as a semi-natural reference  

We analyse a suite of soil variables (e.g. infiltration, available water storage, bare soil cover) using **mixed-effects models**, multivariete analysis, and **visualisations** (boxplots, rainclouds, predicted means with confidence intervals).  
The goal is to understand how **permaculture practices** affect soil functions compared to conventional agriculture and natural habitats.
