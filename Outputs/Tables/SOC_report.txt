We fitted a linear mixed model (estimated using REML and nloptwrap optimizer) to predict SOC with sample_place (formula: log1p(SOC) ~ sample_place). The model included site_id as random effect (formula: ~1 | site_id). The model's total explanatory power is substantial (conditional R2 = 0.68) and the part related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.41. The model's intercept, corresponding to sample_place = Bed, is at 1.74 (95% CI [1.48, 2.00], t(90) = 13.19, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of sample place [Edible forest] is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.21, 95% CI [-0.41, -0.01], t(90) = -2.09, p = 0.039; Std. beta = -0.13, 95% CI [-0.23, -0.02])
  - The effect of sample place [Field] is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.75, 95% CI [-0.95, -0.55], t(90) = -7.45, p < .001; Std. beta = -0.32, 95% CI [-0.42, -0.22])
  - The effect of sample place [Woodland] is statistically significant and positive (beta = 0.33, 95% CI [0.13, 0.53], t(90) = 3.26, p = 0.002; Std. beta = 0.14, 95% CI [0.04, 0.25])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
